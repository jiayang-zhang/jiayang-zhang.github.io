# Hello! ☀️
I'm Jiayang, a MRes Biomedical Research student at Imperial College London. My main research interests lie in **geometric deep learning and generative AI for applications in biomedicine**, examples like AI virtual cells and de novo protein design. 

## 👩🏻‍🌾 Experience

[//]: # (Overtime I played with various data modalities through projects, from textual data, fluorescent microscopy images, brain functional MRI tabular data, protein sequences, graphs for drugs.)

### Sheffield 2023-2025
From 2023 to 2025, I was fortunate to join Prof Haiping Lu’s group at the University of Sheffield as an AI Research Engineer (AIRE). During this time, I progressed in applying software engineering and multimodal AI through working on three projects: 

- [Neuropathic pain patient stratification and biomarker detection](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-032-05182-0_24)
- [Virus-like particle stoichiometry classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12049)
- [Multimodal learning library PyKale](https://github.com/pykale/pykale)

Also together with the community, we published [our perspective on deployment-centric multimodal AI](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-025-01116-5) and run an [annual Multimodal AI workshop](https://multimodalai.github.io/) in the UK.

Sheffield is a great hilly city to live in, with tasty tap water and the Peak District just 15 minutes away by car. I had a wonderful time living there! If you happen to be visiting, I recommend [Within Reason](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Within+Reason/@53.379555,-1.481136,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x4879827fc63d1be1:0xfb552df08d76fb2b!8m2!3d53.379555!4d-1.4785611!16s%2Fg%2F1x5qs980?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MTIwOS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D), where you get recharged just by walking in and seeing the lovely collections of things they sell, and [Tamper Coffee](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Tamper+Coffee/@53.379555,-1.481136,17z?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MTIwOS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) for a tasty brunch. For those in Sheffield, I also recommend exploring [Bloom](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bloom+Sheffield+CIC/@53.3453704,-1.496783,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x4879833ea229cf67:0x675916afa9eaa006!8m2!3d53.3453718!4d-1.4783292!16s%2Fg%2F11sz3vt07r?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MTIwOS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) for some quiet gardening time, and [Blue Cross](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Blue+Cross+Rehoming+and+Advice+Unit,+Sheffield/@53.345951,-1.5130099,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x4879835984914ab1:0xa3aa74e96ed7a938!8m2!3d53.3459524!4d-1.4945561!16s%2Fg%2F11g1qjt7dd?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MTIwOS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) for dog fostering. :)
